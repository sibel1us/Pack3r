# Pack3r
Tool to pack release-ready .pk3-files using the source .map-file. Mainly for use with Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. Written in a couple of days for fun, and all testing was done by hand. *Always manually check the pk3 yourself before releasing.*

## Possible future functionality
Parameter for a custom release name, to allow beta versions to be released without needing to rename filename-dependent files by hand (such as mapscript, arena, and levelshots).

## Missing functionality
- Possibly some obscure entity keys that load shaders/models
- Skins
- Shader references (sunshader, q3map_cloneShader)
